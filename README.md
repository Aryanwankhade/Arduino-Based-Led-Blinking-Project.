# Arduino-Based-Led-Blinking-Project.
This is my first project on microcontroller.
In which the Led is Blinked repeatedly as a loop.
In this Project The use of componet are:-
> Breadboard.
> resistors 220K.
> led (any colour).
> Arduino UNO R3 Microcontroller.

Note :- you can change the time of blinking by adding or subtracting the seconds inside the source code.
